title: Welcome to My Blog!
---
My name is Pat Mendus and I currently live in Bellevue, Washington. Like many people this year, I've picked up a few pandemic hobbies, mainly **foraging** and activities that are foraging-adjacent like camping. I've been foraging for about a year, and after a year I've learned enough not to poison myself or my fiancÃ©e, Lizzie, 90% of the time (for some reason, everyone always focuses on that last 10% ðŸ˜•). I've decided to start this blog as a way for me to keep track of what I'm doing, what I'm eating (what I shouldn't have eaten), what gear I've used, and whatever else pops in my head.
